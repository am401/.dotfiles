## my .dotfiles
Having to swap between work and home devices where I work using vim and tmux, centralizing my dotfiles makes sense. It's also been a minute since I've taken the time to invest updating things like `.vimrc` or create new alises for `zsh`.

This repo intends to help keep things in order for a more fluid transition between devices.
